## <font color="red"><b>WARNING !!!</b></font>

This is a beta release. It may contain bugs and problems. 

Please be patient while using it and report back any problem you have encountered to https://github.com/orcun-gokbulut/qml-debug/issuess

Thank you for using Qml-Debug Beta.

## Description
**Short Description:** QML Debuger for VSCode.

**Detailed Description:** Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), which is used by Visual Studio Code to interface with various debuggers, implementation for Qt QML debugger.

https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/

## Usage
Right now only attach mode debugging is supported which means you have to launch your application (by hand or through another Visual Studio Code launch configuration) and then attach Qml Debugger.

This limitation will be lifted in future releases. Qml Debug will eventually gain the ability to launch your application.
### Attach Mode
Attach mode attaches Qml Debugger in the already running application instance.

**Sample launch.json Configuration:**
```json
{

    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "QML Debug: Attach",
            "type": "qml",
            "request": "attach",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 12150,
            "paths": {
                "qrc:/qml-debug-test-app/qml": "${workspaceFolder}/qml"
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

**Configuration Properties**
 - **name**: Name of your configuration.
 - **type**: Type of your debugger extension. This should be qml.
 - **request** (Default: attach): Debugger mode. Only attach mode is supported for now. Therefore this should be attach.
 - **host** (Default: 127.0.0.1): Hostname/IP Address of the computer that debugee will be run.
 - **port** (Default: 12150): Port number of the debugger.
 - **paths**: List of Qml paths that will be matched to physical paths for debugger to load correct source code.


#### Mapping Virtual paths to Physical Paths
In order to Qml Debuger find your source code, you should have one or more path matching options in your configuration. These mapping tuples are contained in configuration's path property.

**Example:**
```json
"paths": {
    "qrc:/qml-debug-test-app": "${workspaceFolder}/src/qml",
    "qrc:/qml-debug-test-app/ui": "${workspaceFolder}/src/ui/qml"
}
```

#### Launching Your Application

In order to debug your Qml based application in attach mode you have to start your binary with debug parameters;

```sh
./your_qml_app -qmljsdebugger=host:127.0.0.1,port:12150,block,services:DebugMessages,QmlDebugger,V8Debugger,QmlInspector
```

These parameters will instruct Qt to load necessary debugger plugins and extensions. On launch mode Qml Debugger extension will add these paramters automaticly but in attach mode you have to add it yourself when you are launching your application by hand.

You can also use VSCode launch.json configuration to append the parameters by adding flowing lines to your configration;;

```json
"args": [
    "-qmljsdebugger=host:localhost,port:12150,services:DebugMessages,QmlDebugger,V8Debugger"
]
```

#### Attach with C++ Debugger
If you want use multiple debugger (C++ and Qml) at the same time you should crate compatable one Qml Debug configuƒ±ration and one cppdbg configuration then combine them into launch compound.

You should make sure that cppdbg launch configration launches application with debugging command line arguments with correct hostname and port values that matches with your Qml Debug launch configuration.

**Command Line Arguments:**

-qmljsdebugger=host:**localhost**,port:**12150**,services:DebugMessages,QmlDebugger,V8Debugger

**Launch Configuration:**

"host": **"localhost"**,<br>
"port": **12150**,


**Example compund launch configration;**
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        // C++ Launcher
        {
            "name": "C++ Debug: Launch",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/your_qml_application",
            "args": [
                "-qmljsdebugger=host:localhost,port:12150,services:DebugMessages,QmlDebugger,V8Debugger"
            ]
        },
        // Qml Attacher
        {
            "name": "QML Debug: Attach",
            "type": "qml",
            "request": "attach",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 12150,
            "paths": {
                "qrc:/qml": "${workspaceFolder}/qml"
            }
        },
    ],
    "compounds": [
        {
          "name": "C++/QML Debug: Launch",
          "configurations": ["C++ Debug: Launch", "QML Debug: Attach"]
        }
    ]
}
```
